# Node.js Basics Project

This repository contains a series of tasks and projects related to learning the basics of Node.js, covering various concepts such as file I/O, HTTP servers, and using frameworks like Express.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Executing Basic JavaScript with Node.js**: 
   - Creating functions and handling input/output using Node.js.

2. **Using Process stdin**:
   - Utilizing the process.stdin object to handle user input in Node.js.

3. **Reading Files Synchronously and Asynchronously**:
   - Reading files synchronously and asynchronously in Node.js, with error handling and logging.

4. **Creating HTTP Servers with Node's HTTP Module**:
   - Creating simple HTTP servers using Node's built-in HTTP module.

5. **Creating More Complex HTTP Servers with Node's HTTP Module**:
   - Building more complex HTTP servers with multiple endpoints and handling different routes.

6. **Creating Small HTTP Servers using Express**:
   - Implementing basic HTTP servers using the Express framework for Node.js.

7. **Creating More Complex HTTP Servers using Express**:
   - Developing more advanced HTTP servers using Express with additional functionality.

8. **Organizing a Complex HTTP Server using Express**:
   - Structuring a full server with controllers, routes, and utilities using Express.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Contains classes and methods for handling application logic.
- **Routes**: Defines the endpoints and links them to corresponding controller methods.
- **Utilities**: Contains utility functions used across the project.
- **Server File**: Initializes the Express server, sets up routes, and starts the server.
